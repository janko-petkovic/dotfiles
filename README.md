# dotfiles
Some core dotfiles I use on every machine.
The tree is already setup to stow everything in the correct folders once you clone the repo.

## Requirements
A lazy file I will try to keep updated with the requirements for the
settings.

### General remember to install
- dunst
- bluez, bluez-utils

### Nvim
- `npm`
- `unzip`
- patched font (say from `https://www.nerdfonts.com/`)
- themes: green 'everforest'

### LaTeX
- `livetex`: install everything - its 2 gigs, not a lot
- `zathura` with `zathura-pdf-mupdf` plugin

### Kitty
- fonts: `Ubuntu Mono`, `Roboto Mono

### Bash
- `fd` an alternative to find to be used with `fzf` for the `sd` command. Dunno
if it performs better but certainly gives many less graphical problems.
